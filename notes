#Editor Config
#########
Set up the baseline decisions about tooling - we need a JavaScript editor
So everyone on our team uses the same critical editor settings, like spaces versus tabs, line endings, and more, by using a standard called editorconfig
1. Create the file with the settings
2. Some editor, like vscode, requires a plugin which have to be installed
(check https://editorconfig.org/)
That's all
